 * - Be picky with importing stuffs into this file, especially for big
 * files and libraries. The bigger the preload scripts get, the slower the modules
 * will load.
 * - Don't assign anything to `global` variable because it will be passed
 * into modules' execution environment.
 * - Make sure this note also presents in other files which are imported here.
